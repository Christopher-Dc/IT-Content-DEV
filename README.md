"Power Glove" & "Use the Force"

During my period at JEToP I developed within a team two prototype:

a glove able to control a video game through the motion of the hand;
a sensor able to understand when the individual was focused measuring his brainwaves.
The result of this process was a rise of a cube obtained through the use of a fan which rotates faster as long as the user is more concentrated.

We presented those products in different occasions: -at the Wearable Tech Torino (WTT), the first event about wearable technologies in Italy organised by JETop. -at TedX Torino, one of the TED-like events supported by TED.
